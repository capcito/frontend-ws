# Frontend Work Sample

Here’s a quick coding challenge. It's important to note that it's by no means a test... We just want to get a sense for how you write code and solve problems.

We have a simple API that returns a JSON array.
We would like you to read the API and display it in an organized way.
In addition, you should add in some sort of sorting mechanic.

The task should preferably be built using Vue 3 or React.
Bonus if you manage to include TailwindCSS & TypeScript, but that’s not a must-have.

Once done, push your work to eg. GitHub and send the link to us,
Timebox ~ 3 hours

## API Endpoint
https://my-json-server.typicode.com/capcito/frontend-ws/companies

## Definition of Done
1. You're able to see a list of all companies.
2. You're able to search by the company name.
3. You're able to sort by the ID (ASC & DESC where DESC is default).

Good Luck!
